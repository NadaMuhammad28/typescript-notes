-TypeScript offers full support for the class keyword introduced in ES2015.

- Class Member 
 --props and methods are called member



--strictPropertyInitialization
  --- The strictPropertyInitialization setting controls whether class fields need to be initialized in the constructor.




-------------------------MEMBER VISIVILITY ------------------------------------


-You can use TypeScript to control whether certain methods or properties are visible to code outside the class.


1- public
  --The default visibility of class members is public. A public member can be accessed anywhere

2- protected 
  --protected members are only visible to subclasses of the class they’re declared in.
  -- not accessed from external code
  -- Using protected member types can help to improve the encapsulation and abstraction of your code, making it easier to reason about and maintain.



3- private
  --private is like protected, but doesn’t allow access to the member even from
  
  




-Visibility modifiers 
-readonly modifier
  --This prevents assignments to the field outside of the constructor.




-------------------------------------------------------------

-overloading 
  -- TypeScript supports method overloading
  -- allows you to define multiple methods with the same name but with different parameter types and/or number of parameters. When calling an overloaded method, 
    TypeScript will choose the method with the best match for the given arguments.

  --   
    

-GETTERS AND SETTERS
 --If get exists but no set, the property is automatically readonly
